  "description": "A web app that mixes free speech and time-release. typeCapsule is little more than a text box that accepts one character of input at a time, and, using socket.io, sends each char in real time to a database (MySQL). After a given time period, all of the posts over that period are released to the public for reading and (possibly) comment. typeCapsule is still very much pre-release.",
