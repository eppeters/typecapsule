Overview and Development Status
========
A web app that mixes free speech and time-release. typeCapsule is little more than a text box that sends its content to a database to be stored without any user details. After a user-given time delay for the message, the post will available to the public for reading.

A while back, typeCapsule underwent a total rewrite (like all 200 lines of it), and currently everything works except retrieving posts (making it pretty useless). Also, there is no pretty UI. Once I hook up the post listing route, it will be extremely simple.

Demo
========
There is a demo available at [http://typecapsule-peteredw.rhcloud.com/](http://typecapsule-peteredw.rhcloud.com/)
